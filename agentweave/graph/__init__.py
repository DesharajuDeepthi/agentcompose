"""LangGraph orchestration module for AgentWeave.

This module provides the graph building and state management using:
- LangGraph StateGraph for workflow orchestration
- LangChain chat models for LLM integration
- create_react_agent for tool-using workers

Usage:
    from agentweave.graph import GraphFactory, GraphState

    factory = GraphFactory(config, agent_registry, llm_factory, tool_registry)
    graph = factory.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)

    result = await graph.ainvoke(initial_state, config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "..."}})
